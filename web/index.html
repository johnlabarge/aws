Hello AWS World

<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: The instance and ebs volume are currently using us-west-1b due to the following error with us-west-1a:
<div style="width:400px; position:relative; left:50px; padding-right:2px"><p>"The requested Availability Zone is currently constrained and we are no longer accepting new customer requests for t1/m1/c1/m2 instance types. Plea
se retry your request by not specifying an Availability Zone or choosing us-west-1b, us-west-1c." 
</p>
</div>
