Hello AWS World


NOTE: The instance and ebs volume are currently using us-west-1b due to the following error with us-west-1a: 
<p class="text-indent:50px">
" The requested Availability Zone is currently constrained and we are no longer accepting new customer requests for t1/m1/c1/m2 instance types. Please retry your request by not specifying an Availability Zone or choosing us-west-1b, us-west-1c."
